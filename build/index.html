      <h2>What is ChaosHacks?</h2>
      <p>ChaosHacks is this year’s iteration of the annual SystemsHacks event, a 12-hour beginner-oriented hackathon run
        by the SFU Software Systems Student Society. SystemsHacks has been organized annually since 2017, with up to 200
        participants each year. Our goal is to facilitate an encouraging and comfortable environment for beginner
        hackers to learn new skills.

      <h2>Software Systems Student Society</h2>
      <p>Software Systems is a program in Simon Fraser University’s School of Computing Science. Based in the Surrey
        Campus, it aims to teach more applied aspects of computer science so that graduates will develop a foundational
        understanding of industry skills. The Software Systems Student Society (SSSS) is the student unions representing
        the interests of the Software Systems student body. We organize events to encourage making valuable peer
        connections and supplement the academic experience.

        <p class="content">
          A hackathon is an event where teams of 2-4 develop (or “hack”) a project in a short period of time. Hackathons
          are often 24 hours or a weekend, but SystemsHacks is 12 hours to make the experience less imposing for
          beginners. Hackathons are an opportunity to experiment with new tools, or try new ideas. They are also a great
          change to make lasting connections with fellow students, mentors, and industry professionals.

          How can I best participate with no hackathon experience?

        </label>
        <p class="content">
          You are not expected to have any experience to participate; everyone starts somewhere! The goal of the event
          is to learn something new; don’t worry if the final result is not particularly polished. Mentors will be
          available to help you work through questions that you may have, and we encourage you and your teammates to
          teach each other as well. Just remember, the primary goal of a hackathon is to learn!

        </label>
        <p class="content">
          The theme can be interpreted loosely in whatever way you see fit; it is just a prompt to get you thinking.
          Your project does not necessarily have to be directly related to plants or roots, so get creative!

        <p class="content">
          If you already have a team in mind, each teammate must register individually for SystemsHacks. You do not have
          to
          notify the organizers of your team before the event, but projects must be submitted by a group of 2-4 people.

        <p class="content">
          You certainly aren’t the only one, many first-time hackers find themselves in the same situation! On the
          morning of the event, there will be a team formation event. We will ask all participants without a team to
          gather somewhere, where you can all form teams on the spot to ensure everyone can participate.

        <p class="content">
          Mentors can answer questions and help fix any technical issues that you may have, but they may not directly
          contribute to your project. They can also help you elaborate your idea in the early stages of the event, so
          don’t hesitate to ask if they have time to chat about your concept!
